## Songshion Working Agreement

1. Working Through Disagreements:
   a. To work through disagreements we will talk through the opposing sides and come to the most logical solution that the majority agrees on.
  
2. When We’ll Work 
   a. We’re going to be honest with each other about our abilities and other life commitments when scheduling project work time. We’ll communicate with each other at least once a day to make sure the work is getting done.
​
3. How We’ll Make Sure We’re All Included 
   a. In order to make sure we are all committing at a similar pace, and work is split up fairly. We will accomplish this by pairing up and splitting up the work based on our strengths.
